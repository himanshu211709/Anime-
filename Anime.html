    <h3>History of Anime</h3>
    <p>
      The history of anime can be traced back to the start of the 20th century,
      with the earliest verifiable films dating from 1907.Before the advent of
      film, Japan already had a rich tradition of entertainment with colourful
      painted figures moving across the projection screen in utsushi-e
      <i>(写し絵)</i>, a particular Japanese type of magic lantern show popular
      in the 19th century. Possibly inspired by European phantasmagoria shows,
      utsushi-e showmen used mechanical slides and developed lightweight wooden
      projectors (furo) that were handheld so that several performers could each
      control the motions of different projected figures. The second generation
      of animators in the late 1910s included Ōten Shimokawa, Jun'ichi Kōuchi
      and Seitaro Kitayama, commonly referred to as the "fathers" of anime.
      Propaganda films, such as Momotarō no Umiwashi (1943) and Momotarō: Umi no
      Shinpei (1945), the latter being the first anime feature film, were made
      during World War II. During the 1970s, anime developed further, with the
      inspiration of Disney animators, separating itself from its Western roots,
      and developing distinct genres such as mecha and its super robot subgenre.
      Typical shows from this period include Astro Boy, Lupin III and Mazinger
      Z. During this period several filmmakers became famous, especially Hayao
      Miyazaki and Mamoru Oshii.
